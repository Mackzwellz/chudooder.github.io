  "body": "# chudooder.github.io\r\nShawn's website fork to implement **the parser of existing chatwheels**\r\n\r\nProceed [here, it's the generator page](../chatwheel.html).\r\n\r\nDownsides (with the current setup):\r\n+ Whenever you bring the chatwheel up in-game, it brings up the one you stopped on during switching. But when you start switching, it starts from the very beginning; this can be misleading, and idk how to fix it, would like to have some input on this.\r\n+ Basic functionality is there, but a lot more need to be done imo.\r\n***\r\n\r\nChanges in this fork:\r\n+ commented a lot of code (most of the work went into this than into actual coding)\r\n+ config parser\r\n+ \"selections\" array now stores actual phrases' gameindexes\r\n+ proper deletion of chatwheel pages (reforms the array and reenumerates the chatwheel pages) \r\n+ TBF: implement 2-key-layout (as found somewhere on reddit, would like to give credit)\r\n\r\nCredits: \r\n+ Valve — DotA 2 and initial phraseList content\r\n+ chudooder ([github.com/chudooder](https://github.com/chudooder)) — inital chatwheel config builder\r\n+ Onekone ([github.com/Onekone](https://github.com/Onekone)) — initial help with understanding of the code, suggestions, guidance and motivation (no Kappa)\r\n+ stackoverflow.com community for providing thorough answers on googled subjects",
